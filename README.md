##Sentiment Analysis App (NLP)

This app will perform sentiment analysis on a customer restaurant review.  For example, if the user inputs a review such as "This was the best restaurant ever", it will be classified as either positive or negative using a machine learning classification model.  Several models were prototyped but the logistic regression model was chosen based off of the confusion matrix metrics and performance on unseen reviews.
